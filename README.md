## About

This **House Price Prediction** system uses a trained regression model to estimate the price of a house based on user-provided features such as:

- Area (in square feet)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Location
- Other related factors (depending on the dataset)

The app interface is built using **Streamlit**, allowing real-time predictions through a clean and interactive UI.
