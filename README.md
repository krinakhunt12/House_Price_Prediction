## About

This **House Price Prediction** system uses a trained regression model to estimate the price of a house based on user-provided features such as:
- Area (sqft)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Location  
and other related factors (depending on your dataset).

The app interface is built using **Streamlit**, allowing real-time predictions with a clean, interactive UI.

---

##  Demo

Run it locally with Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py






## Features


Predicts house prices instantly based on input features

Interactive Streamlit UI

Trained ML model integrated using joblib

Model can be retrained easily using a Jupyter notebook or script

Lightweight and fast ‚Äî easy to deploy on cloud platforms.
